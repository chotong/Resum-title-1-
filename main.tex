I am writing to express my interest in the Technology Spring Insight Programme at Morgan Stanley Glasgow. I always take a great interest in solving real-world problems.
\newline\newline
I am currently majoring in Cognitive Science, an advanced interdisciplinary study between informatics, linguistics, psychology and neuroscience. I have a comprehensive science and engineering background, I believe that by the help of advanced research experience, the mixture study background and innovative consciousness, I can be the best and beyond the best.
\newline\newline
I believe that Morgan Stanley not only provides the best vocational training for students to understand and acquire the ability of solving practical problems but also has the best and advanced technology team that expands students’ vision. An internship at such a company is an invaluable experience that will have an incalculable impact on the future. As well as developing my technical skills, I believe I will also develop a combination of interpersonal skills (such as working in a team and networking) and consulting skills, (advising, managing and analysing) embedding in the Morgan Stanley experience.
\newline\newline
I worked as an intern in Ecolab Great China Headquarters, where I was responsible for database management. During the internship, the most valuable thing was collaboration experience. Communication skill acts as an important role in team work. Morgan Stanley has always been an international company, people from different cultures are here sharing brilliant ideas all day long. I believe working in such a company will require and be able to exercise interpersonal communication skills and team working skills. Understanding the needs of people from different cultures is an important reason for Morgan Stanley’s success. Asia Pacific plays an important role in the commercial market of Morgan Stanley. As an international student, I can make the enterprise more diversified, more understanding demands from Asia Pacific customers.
\newline\newline
I look forward to joining Morgan Stanley Glasgow, thank you for your consideration.
\newline\newline\newline\newline
Sincerely,

Zhaotong JIA
